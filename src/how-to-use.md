# How to Use the Safe to Swim Map

The Safe to Swim map provides near real-time water quality data for California's recreational waters. Here's how to use it effectively. Data is organized into "stations," each representing a specific location where water has been monitored. Stations are color-coded based on their safety status, which is determined by levels of certain types of bacteria (i.e. E. coli). Selecting a station will show its current status as well as historical data.

## Exploring the map

Stations are represented by circles, with colors indicating safety status as shown in the map legend. Click on any station marker to see detailed information about that location.

### Finding a station via the map

To find a station on the map, simply pan and zoom until you locate the desired area. You can click on any station marker to view its details.

### Finding a station via the search bar

To find a station using the search bar, enter the name or code of the station you're looking for. The map will automatically pan and zoom to the location of the station. You may also filter stations using the dropdown menu next to the search bar.

## Viewing station details

When you click on a station, a popup will appear on the map with the name and station code of the station. On the right side is further information about the station, including its current status, a description of that status, and the date of the last sample taken.
